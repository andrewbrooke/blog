And we're back! For 2017 at Syntonic we want to kick things off the right way, and what better way to do that then with a new video series! Check out the first episode on Youtube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpUrRRbPdX8), and stay tuned for future episodes!

This series is going to be mostly developer centric, but we will also we talking about tech and hardware news, our own apps, as well as code demo segments for a variety of different projects. Feel free to follow along if you are interested in coding with us!
