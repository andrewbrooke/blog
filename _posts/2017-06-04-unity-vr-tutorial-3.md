The third episode of our Unity VR video series is [now available!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rir4A1cr03E)

This time, we start a new project to build a virtual reality whiteboard. In part 1, we cover the general project and scene setup, and detect collisions with the whiteboard.

Follow along with the code for this video in our [Github repository.](https://github.com/SyntonicApps/unity-vrtk-examples)
