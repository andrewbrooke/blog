I'm basically half asleep as I type this out, just returning from our second hackathon experience, at [Hack OHI/O 2016](http://hack.osu.edu/2016/). This was an incredible experience, and proper credit has to go out to the sponsors who make it possible for us 750+ student hackers to attend.

Joe, Caleb, and I (the three founding members of Syntonic) went into this thing with a relatively simple idea, and I'm proud of how it turned out so far. It's an app called FireStream, and it basically allows you to host and build socially based community music playlists known as Parties. Whether it be at a real party, or just when you're hanging out with friends, it's always a hassle to juggle who has control of the aux cord. This is a problem that I've personally faced countless times, and the aim of our app is to help alleviate the difficulty from those scenarios.

Users with a Spotify premium account (and hopefully other music streaming services in the future) will be able to "host" a new party, and build up the initial playlist, either from one of their preexisting Spotify playlists, or by using what we call the "Smart Builder."

This allows the user to enter a number of criteria for what their playlist should sound like, including up to five options mixing and matching between Genre, Artist, and Title. All of these components will have an effect on the resulting playlist.

After starting a party, you can start to invite your friends, who can then request to add songs (without the need for any streaming service account of their own) through the search feature. Hosts are given full control over the music, like a normal music player app, and all of party goers are kept in sync, seeing the same state of the party on their own screen.

There are a lot of other features that we are hoping to add in the relatively near future, so you can expect some updates from us on this project soon.

Aside from the actual coding, the Hack OHI/O was once again an incredible experience. We got the chance to meet a lot of people from different companies and schools, and learn what other people were making. The food we were served was also pretty darn good, so props to the Ohio Union for hooking the hungry coders up.

As an added bonus, our team scored in the Top 10 teams, winning the category for Best Teamwork. I'm so glad that we were able to complete most of the ideas our vision detailed, especially in under 24 hours. I really enjoyed working on the project, and am excited to see where it can grow from here. Hackathons are awesome, and I can't overstate how much I think you should attend one if you get the opportunity. Thanks Caleb and Joe, and everyone that helped HackOHI/O be what it is.
